Microchip ATSAMA5 SoC Multiple Vulnerabilities
==============================================

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered which affect the security of solutions
built using the Microchip ATSAMA5 SoC series, when making use of the Secure Boot
capabilities of these SoCs. This pre-release advisory describes the identified
vulnerable situations and affected part numbers while trying to limit exposure for
products integrating these SoCs. The full technical advisory will be released in
the near future.


Improper applet handling
------------------------

A programming error was discovered which allows an attacker to bypass existing
security mechanisms related to applet handling when the attacked device is in
Secure Mode.

This only affects products which have Secure Monitor enabled.


CMAC verification susceptible to SPA
------------------------------------

The AES-128 based CMAC authentication is used to prove authenticity and integrity
of software components such as monitor applets and bootstrap code. The implementation
of CMAC verification functionality was found to be vulnerable to timing and power
analysis attacks.


Hardcoded keys are used for protecting applets
----------------------------------------------

It was found that the key set used to encrypt and authenticate secure applets is
hardcoded within the Secure Monitor and is available for abuse once this code has
been extracted.

This only affects products which have Secure Monitor enabled.


Impact
------

The cumulative impact of the described issues leads to a significant compromise of
the expected security guarantees provided by the Secure Boot feature when no
mitigations are applied.

Solution
--------

For products based on the SAMA5D2 and SAMA5D4 devices, disabling the SAM-BA monitor
after provisioning the chips mitigates all the reported issues. This can be done by
setting the "Disable Monitor" bit in the fuse area.

CMAC verification issue may be mitigated by choosing the RSA authentication option to
replace CMAC calculation.

For products based on the SAMA5D3 devices, no mitigations were identified. The only
identified solution is to update the products to the next silicon revision when made
available by Microchip.
