Security advisory: OP-TEE TrustZone bypass at wakeup on NXP i.MX6UL
===================================================================

The Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE) [1] is an open source
Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) implementing the Arm TrustZone technology.

F-Secure Foundry, in the process of developing its own TEE framework (GoTEE
[2]), reviewed the existing Open Source offering and identified a vulnerability
in OP-TEE support for the Central Security Unit (CSU) configuration on the NXP
i.MX6UL System-on-Chip (SoC).

Based on this, as well as previous [7] findings, F-Secure advises OP-TEE users
to treat all OP-TEE supported platforms as insecure by default and carefully
review and practically test their implementation before integration.

TrustZone configuration on i.MX SoCs
------------------------------------

The following GoTEE tutorial [3] provides an in-depth explanation of the
various aspects of an effective TrustZone configuration.

In a nutshell, along with standard ARM core configuration, each SoC requires
its peripherals to be assigned to either the Secure World or Normal World (aka
NonSecure World), which respectively represent the privileged and unprivileged
TrustZone domains.

The Central Security Unit (CSU) is the component that enables TrustZone
peripheral configuration on the NXP i.MX family for peripherals that are
not capable of asserting TrustZone signals independently.

The CSU Config Security Level (CSL) defines restrictions for accessing
individual (or groups of) peripherals (e.g. whether a peripheral can be
accessed from NonSecure World) while the Security Access (SA) defines the
access security policy for the peripheral (e.g. whether the peripheral
makes bus accesses as "Secure" or "NonSecure").

Vulnerability (CVE-2021-44149)
------------------------------

The OP-TEE OS CSU driver [4] sets the CSU Security Access (SA) policy for the
ARM Cortex-A7 block (CA7) to "Secure" for its NXP i.MX6UL SoC support.

The NXP documentation on the role of the CA7 SA setting does not provide any
details on its effects, therefore F-Secure conducted a thorough analysis of its
impact when set as "Secure".

It has been verified that a CA7 SA set to "Secure" allows to suspend a
processor in "NonSecure" security state and have it wakeup from low power mode
in Secure World.

The wakeup sequence implemented in the NXP i.MX6UL boot ROM jumps, in secure
processor state, to function pointers held in the System Reset Controller (SRC)
registers. The vulnerability takes place when the Normal World OS is allowed to
set the SRC wakeup pointers before going in low power mode.

For example when running Linux under OP-TEE OS, which sets the CA7 SA to
"Secure", the boot ROM executes a wakeup handler previously configured by
Normal World Linux, within Secure World. This results in Linux re-initializing
the MMU and resuming all its execution context as Secure World.

This configuration effectively bypasses any intended TrustZone protection as
the Normal World OS is capable of transforming itself, through a low power
suspend/wakeup procedure, to a Secure one.

Impact
------

On vanilla OP-TEE OS the NXP i.MX6UL SoC has no effective TrustZone isolation
as the Normal World can arbitrarily change its processor state to Secure World,
resulting in a full compromise of the Trusted Execution Environment.

The same vulnerability also applies to the NXP OP-TEE fork [5].

Mitigation
----------

When suspend/wakeup functionality is required the sequence must be handled by
the Secure World TEE and the CSU Config Security Level (CSL) must be set to
protect, from Normal World access, all blocks responsible for the wakeup
sequence such as the GPC and SRC blocks on the i.MX6UL SoC family.

When suspend/wakeup functionality is not required, implementers of trusted
firmware using the OP-TEE framework must re-configure the SA policy ensuring
that the CA7 value is set as "NonSecure" prior to Normal World execution.

When running Linux in Normal World this is incompatible with Linux power
management drivers which require SRC support on i.MX6 SoCs (example:
`CONFIG_CPU_IDLE`).

It is emphasized that the role of CA7 SA policy bit has been identified by
F-Secure through testing and is pending verification by NXP on its complete
effects.

Please also note that such mitigations do not constitute an example of a fully
secure configuration and only focus on the specific aspects reported in this
advisory.

Vendor response
---------------

The OP-TEE project own security advisory can be found at [8].

Affected versions
-----------------

The OP-TEE OS component of all OP-TEE releases supporting the NXP i.MX6UL SoC
is vulnerable, this includes any fork (such as the NXP one [5]) based on them
that does not correctly prevent Normal World control of the System Reset
Controller (SRC) wakeup execution context.

Please be advised that OP-TEE does not provide a secure CSU configuration on
multiple NXP i.MX P/Ns for reasons which go beyond this specific finding (see
CVE-2021-36133 [7]).
